 * or 'BUG_CONTAINER' (reducer used for both) of the redux state.
 * 
 * Note: The purpose of the 'massDeleteList' property is to be used to delete 
 * multiple items (i.e. projects or bugs) at once. This is for quality of life
 * as delete items one by one would may be tedious.
 *
 * @param {number[]} state - Current Array (in the redux state) containing ids
 * of either projects or bugs (not both) to be deleted
 * @param {Object} action - Object with a 'container' property (determins where 
 * in the redux state) and 'type' property (determins what task to do there).
 * Also may have additional properties with data needed for the task (usually
 * data to be updated in the redux state).
 * @returns {number[]} Array containing ids of either projects or bugs (not 
 * both) to be deleted
