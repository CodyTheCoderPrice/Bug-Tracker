/**
 * Used to set 'componentsDisplay' property into either 'PROJECT_CONTAINER' or
 * 'BUG_CONTAINER' (reducer used for both) of the redux state for either which
 * project or bug components should be displayed by the app. At most, 
 * actions.displays should have one of either its listView or itemView properties
 * set to true. If both are set to true in aciton.displays, then listView will
 * take priorty and itemView will be set to false in the redux state. Also
 * actions.displays should not have listView's child components (i.e. 
 * listViewDeleteModal & listViewCreateItemSidbar) set to true if listView is 
 * not. Neither should itemView's child component (i.e. itemViewDeleteModal) be
 * set to true if itemView is not. If this is the case for either of them, then
 * their child components will be set to false in the redux state. If any 
 * expected properties in action.displays (e.g. listView, itemView, ect.) are 
 * undefined, then they will be set to false/null (depending on their type) in
 * the redux state.
 *
 * Note: The purpose of the listView, listViewDeleteModal, listViewCreateItemSidbar,
 * itemView, and itemViewDeleteModal properties inside this reducer are to be 
 * used as flags for whether the components they represent (they share the same 
 * name, e.g. listView represents the ListView component) should be displayed by
 * the app. The purpose of itemViewEditItemInfo property is to be used to 
 * indaicate for ItemView component to display ItemViewDisplayItemInfo child 
 * component when false and ItemViewEditItemInfo child component when true. The
 * purpose of itemViewCurrentItem property is to be used to indicate which item
 * (project or bug) is currently attached to the ItemView component, so that 
 * item's info can be displayed in the ItemView component.
