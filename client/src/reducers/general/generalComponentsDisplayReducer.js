/**
 * Used to set 'componentsDisplay' property into GENERAL_CONTAINER of the redux
 * state for which general components should be displayed by the app. Exactly
 * one of actions.displays register, login, and home properties should set to 
 * true at any given point in time. If an account is logged into the app (i.e.
 * there is a jwToken in localStoreage), then home component will be set to true
 * while register and login components set to false in the redux state, even if
 * home was not attempted to be set to true. If more or less than one of these 
 * components is true in actions.displays but no account is logged into the
 * app, then either login or register will be set to true in the redux state, 
 * with login taking prioirty over register. If any expected properties in 
 * actions.displays (e.g. resgister, login, ect.) are undefined, then they will
 * be set to false in the redux state (except for itemViewListSidebar, which 
 * will be set to true).
 * 
 * Note: The purpose of the register, login, home, and itemViewListSidebar 
 * properties inside this reducer are to be used as flags for whether the 
 * components they represent (they share the same name, e.g. home represents the
 * Home component) should be displayed by the app. The purpose of the
 * itemViewListSidebarUserSet property is to be used as a flag for whether the
 * the app should auto-decide if ItemViewListSidebar should display based on the
 * current window size. If false it will continue to auto-decide, if true it 
 * will not auto-decide.
 *
 * @param {{
 * 	register: boolean,
 * 	login: boolean,
 * 	home: boolean,
 * 	itemViewListSidebar: boolean,
 * 	itemViewListSidebarUserSet: boolean
 * }} state - Current Object (in the redux state) for which general components
 * are being displayed by the app
 * @param {Object} action - Object with a 'container' property (determins where
 * in the redux state) and 'type' property (determins what task to do there).
 * Also may have additional properties with data needed for the task (usually
 * data to be updated in the redux state).
 * @returns {{
 * 	register: boolean,
 * 	login: boolean,
 * 	home: boolean,
 * 	itemViewListSidebar: boolean,
 * 	itemViewListSidebarUserSet: boolean
 * }} Object for which general components should display by the app
