 * where all global constant values are located and can be pulled from. This is
 * not only for organizational puposes, but also to help ensure consistency 
 * across the app as many of these constant values should be shared between 
 * components.
 *

 * }} state - Current Object (in the redux state) containing constant data used 
 * globally by the app
 * @param {Object} action - Object with a 'container' property (determins where 
 * in the redux state) and 'type' property (determins what task to do there).
 * Also may have additional properties with data needed for the task (usually
 * data to be updated in the redux state).
